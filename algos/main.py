    Binary Trees https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/tutorial-on-binary-tree/
        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/types-of-binary-tree/
        Types of Binary Tree based on the number of children:
            Full Binary Tree
            Degenerate (or pathological) tree
            Skewed Binary Tree https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/skewed-binary-tree/
        Types of Binary Tree On the basis of the completion of levels:
            Complete Binary Tree https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/complete-binary-tree/
            Perfect Binary Tree https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-binary-tree/ 
        On the basis of node values, the Binary Tree can be classified into the following special types:
            Binary Search Tree
            AVL Tree
            Red Black Tree
            B Tree
            B+ Tree
            Segment Tree
    Prefix-Tree / Trie

Linked List https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/linked-list-data-structure/
    Data Structure: Non-contiguous
    Memory Allocation: Typically allocated one by one to individual elements

# I. DIVIDE AND CONQUER PATTERN
# ======================================================================
# "Divide and Conquer" is a powerful algorithmic paradigm that works by
# recursively breaking down a problem into two or more sub-problems of the
# same or related type, until these become simple enough to be solved
# directly. The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a
# solution to the original problem.
#
# The process generally involves three steps:
# 1. **Divide**: Break the given problem into sub-problems of the same type.
# 2. **Conquer**: Recursively solve these sub-problems. If the sub-problems
#    are small enough, solve them directly (the base case).
# 3. **Combine**: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to create a
#    solution to the original problem.

def merge_sort(arr: List[Any]) -> List[Any]:

    Sorts an array using the Merge Sort algorithm. This is a canonical

    - Divide: The array is divided into two halves.
    - Conquer: Each half is sorted recursively.
    - Combine: The two sorted halves are merged together.

    Sorts an array using the Quick Sort algorithm.
    - Divide: The array is partitioned into three parts based on a 'pivot':
      elements smaller than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and
      elements larger than the pivot.
    - Conquer: The sub-arrays of smaller and larger elements are sorted recursively.
    - Combine: The sorted smaller elements, the pivot elements, and the
      sorted larger elements are concatenated.
    Time Complexity: Average O(n log n), Worst O(n^2)
    Space Complexity: O(log n) for the recursion stack.

      subarray that crosses the midpoint. The combine step finds the max
      crossing subarray sum and returns the maximum of the three.
